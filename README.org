* README

=mastodon.el= is an Emacs client for the Mastodon and Pleroma social networks. For info see https://joinmastodon.org/.

** Installation

Clone this repository and add the lisp directory to your load path.
Then, require it and go.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/mastodon.el/lisp")
    (require 'mastodon)
#+END_SRC

Or, with =use-package=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package mastodon
    :ensure t)
#+END_SRC

The minimum Emacs version is now 27.1. But if you are running an older version it shouldn't be very hard to get it working.

*** MELPA

Add =MELPA= to your archives:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'package)
  (add-to-list 'package-archives
               '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t)
#+END_SRC

Update and install:

=M-x package-refresh-contents RET=

=M-x package-install RET mastodon RET=

*** Emoji

=mastodon-mode= will enable [[https://github.com/iqbalansari/emacs-emojify][Emojify]] if it is loaded in your Emacs environment, so
there's no need to write your own hook anymore. =emojify-mode= is not required.

*** Discover

=mastodon-mode= can provide a context menu for its keybindings if [[https://github.com/mickeynp/discover.el][Discover]] is
installed. It is not required.

if you have Discover, add the following to your Emacs init configuration:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'mastodon-discover)
  (with-eval-after-load 'mastodon (mastodon-discover))
#+END_SRC

Or, with =use-package=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package mastodon
    :ensure t
    :config
    (mastodon-discover))
#+END_SRC

** Usage

*** Logging in to your instance

You need to set 2 variables in your init file to get started:

1. =mastodon-instance-url=
2. =mastodon-active-user=

(see their doc strings for details). For example If you want to post
toots as "example_user@social.instance.org", then put this in your init
file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (setq mastodon-instance-url "https://social.instance.org"
          mastodon-active-user "example_user")
#+END_SRC

Then *restart* Emacs and run =M-x mastodon=. Make sure you are connected
to internet before you do this. If you have multiple mastodon accounts
you can activate one at a time by changing those two variables and
restarting Emacs.

If you were using mastodon.el before 2FA was implemented and the above steps
do not work, delete the old file specified by =mastodon-client--token-file= and
restart Emacs and follow the steps again.

*** Timelines

=M-x mastodon=

Opens a =*mastodon-home*= buffer in the major mode and displays  toots. If your credentials are not yet saved, you
will be prompted for email and password. The app registration process will
take place if your =mastodon-token-file= does not contain =:client_id= and
=:client_secret=.

**** Toot byline legend

|----------------+------------------------|
| Marker         | Meaning                |
|----------------+------------------------|
| =(B)=            | I boosted this toot    |
| =(F)=            | I favourited this toot |
| (=K=) (or emoji) | I bookmarked this toot |
|----------------+------------------------|

*** Composing toots

=M-x mastodon-toot= (or =t= from a mastodon.el buffer).

Pops a new buffer/window in =mastodon-toot= minor mode. Enter the
contents of your toot here. =C-c C-c= sends the toot. =C-c C-k= cancels.
Both actions kill the buffer and window.

Autocompletion of mentions and tags is provided by mastodon company backends
(requires =company-mode= and =mastodon-toot--enable-completion= must be set to =t=)
. Type =@= or =#= followed by two or more characters for candidates to appear.

Replies preserve visibility status/content warnings, and include boosters by default.

Server's max toot length, and attachment previews, are shown.

You can download and use your instance's custom emoji
(=mastodon-toot--download-custom-emoji=, =mastodon-toot--enable-custom-emoji=).

*** Customization

See =M-x customize-group RET mastodon= to view all customize options.

- Timeline options:
   - Use proportional fonts
   - Timestamp format
   - Relative timestamps
   - Display user avatars
   - Avatar image hight
   - Enable image caching

- Compose options:
   - Completion for mentions and tags
   - Enable custom emoji
   - Display toot being replied to

*** Live-updating timelines: =mastodon-async-mode=

(code taken from https://github.com/alexjgriffith/mastodon-future.el.)

Works for federated, local, and home timelines and for notifications. It's a
little touchy, one thing to avoid is trying to load a timeline more than once
at a time. It can go off the rails a bit, but it's still pretty cool. The
current maintainer of =mastodon.el= is unable to debug improve this feature.

To enable, it, add =(require 'mastodon-async)= to your =init.el=. Then you can
view a timeline with one of the commands that begin with
=mastodon-async--stream-=.

*** Translating toots

You can translate toots with =mastodon-toot--translate-toot-text=. At the moment
this requires [[https://codeberg.org/martianh/lingva.el][lingva.el]], a little interface I wrote to https://lingva.ml, to
be installed to work.

You could easily modify the simple function to use your emacs translator of
choice (=libretrans.el= , =google-translate=, =babel=, =go-translate=, etc.), you just
need to fetch the toot's content with =(mastodon-tl--content toot)= and pass it
to your translator function as its text argument. Here's what
=mastodon-toot--translate-toot-text= looks like:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun mastodon-toot--translate-toot-text ()
    "Translate text of toot at point.
    Uses `lingva.el'."
      (interactive)
      (let* ((toot (mastodon-tl--property 'toot-json)))
        (if toot
            (lingva-translate nil (mastodon-tl--content toot))
          (message "No toot to translate?"))))
#+end_src

** Dependencies

Hard dependencies (should all install with =mastodon.el=):
- =request= (for uploading attachments), https://github.com/tkf/emacs-request
- =persist= for storing some settings across sessions
- =ts= for poll relative expiry times

Optional dependencies:
- =company= for autocompletion of mentions and tags when composing a toot
- =emojify= for inserting and viewing emojis
- =mpv= and =mpv.el= for viewing videos and gifs
- =lingva.el= for translating toots
